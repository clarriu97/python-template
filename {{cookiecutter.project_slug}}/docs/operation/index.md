# Operation

Here you have to place everything related with the non-development process.
Your application can work on your local machine, but it's very different and
complicated to make it work into production. So, how do you do that? This is
what you should fin in the operations section

For example: if your application is released as a Docker image, how do you
build it? Is it authomated or does the developer need to do anything? How
to trigger this action? What actions do you have to do in this process?
Do you have to update the documentation, any clients documentation, do you
have to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file?
