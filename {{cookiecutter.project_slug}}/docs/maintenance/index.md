# Maintenance

Every product needs maintenance.
Maybe it's not that well known,
but software isn't an exception.
There always are tons of technical debt and problems will appear.

Example:

- Solve security issues that appear in the libraries you are using.
- Develop new features.
- Migration of your programming language version because it will no longer have support.
- Change the environment in which your application is released.
- Solve technical debt.
- Etc.
